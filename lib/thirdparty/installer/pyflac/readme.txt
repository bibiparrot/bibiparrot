pyflac - FLAC in Python
-----------------------
This is a simple wrapper for some of libFLAC, namely the file decoder, file
encoder, and metadata interfaces. Most of the functions of these interfaces
are working.

The wrappers are mostly generated by SWIG. Using them should be intuitive
for those already familiar with the C FLAC interfaces (n.b. where the
FLAC documentation uses 64 bit integers you should use a Python long).
Fairly complete sample code testing most of the functionality can be
found in the examples directory.
