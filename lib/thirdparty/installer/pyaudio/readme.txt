PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms.

PyAudio is still super-duper alpha quality. It has run on GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Mac OS Xâ€”but it could use more testing.
